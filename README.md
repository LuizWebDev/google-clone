GOOGLE CLONE PROJECT (LUIZ, HAKEEM, ANWAR)

We could develop the API's using the routes. 
We couldnt find a way of linking the routes to the google button...
Should we have used the fetch aproach? Is fetch the best way of doing it when we need to use the data response to manipulate de DOM?


how to use the data response from the endpoints ?
Should I store it in a variable? How?
I guess it can be done by using fetch but still dont see how to implement it...
Is there any other way of implementing this using the routes on our index.js?


After a lot of google searches I couldnt see becouse most of the examples Ive found was based in fetching one url rather than an array of objects.
